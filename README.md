Freshdesk API nodes to use in Node Red

I never expected this would actually get downloads in 1 day of release so let me make this clear.
I started development of these nodes for my own internship and free to use for others.
I can never promise I will make a lot of nodes and there is a chance I will stop after I create all the CRUD nodes for contacts and companies.
Though I might update this more.

Any support I will appreciate greatly and you can support the project on github

## Warnings
* The delete company node will permanently delete a company without warnings. This can be dangerous. Any contacts associated with the company will NOT be removed.
